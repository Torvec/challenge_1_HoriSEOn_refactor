# HoriSEOn Website Refactor
A UC Berkley Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp Week 01 Challenge

## Description

The week 01 bootcamp challenge was to refactor the HTML and CSS code for the Horiseon company web page. The original code used non-semantic HTML and the CSS had a lot of redundant code that needed to be removed. The overall look of the site remained the same after all of the changes were made but the underlying code was more semantic and efficient.
